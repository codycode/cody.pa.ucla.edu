title: Theme development using Bootstrap
---
Wï»¿e can use [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) to create the design for sites.  This needs to fit within the theme format for the static site generator.  This site is using [the jekyll minima theme](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) that's stored inside a Ruby gem.  Customizing that would require overriding the gem version.
